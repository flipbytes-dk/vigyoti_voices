Customer: Hi, I'm Michael Chen. Um, I’ve been trying to eat healthier lately, but it's been kind of... overwhelming with all the different diets out there. I was wondering if your services can help me figure out a plan that's, you know, personalized for my needs?

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, Michael! At Elite Nutritionists and Dietitian Services, our dietitians specialize in creating personalized nutrition plans that fit your lifestyle and goals. They can definitely help clear up the confusion and set you on a path that's tailored just for you.

Customer: Oh, that's great to hear. Do you offer consultations to get started, or how does it work?
