Customer: Hi, I'm Michael Chen. Uh, I'm looking to book a getaway for a weekend and I heard you offer some really, um, specialized services for bed and breakfasts. I was wondering if you have any, like, recommendations or packages that might include local tours or activities?

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, Michael! We offer a range of packages that include not only a cozy stay at various charming bed and breakfasts but also guided tours and local experiences tailored to your interests. Um, are there any specific activities you're interested in, like wine tasting or hiking?
