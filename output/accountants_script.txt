AI Receptionist: Good afternoon, Precision Tax & Accounting, this is the AI receptionist speaking. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, uh, this is Andrew Davis. I was wondering about some help with, like, small business taxes. Do you guys handle that?

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, Andrew! We specialize in small business taxes among other services. How are you doing today?

Customer: I'm good, thanks. So, um, I just started my own little business and I'm kinda new to this whole tax thing. I really need some guidance.

AI Receptionist: Of course, starting a new business is exciting but taxes can definitely be a bit overwhelming. I'd recommend setting up a business tax consultation with one of our experts. They can walk you through everything you need to know.
