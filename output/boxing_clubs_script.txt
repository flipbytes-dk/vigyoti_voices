AI Receptionist: Hi, this is Quality Boxing Club Services. I am Bella, Quality Boxing Club Services AI receptionist. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm Michael Chen. Uh, I’ve been thinking about starting boxing classes and I wanted to know, like, do you guys offer beginner sessions? I'm pretty new to all this.

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, Michael! We definitely offer beginner classes. They're really popular for folks just starting out, and our trainers are great at getting you comfortable with the basics. Is there anything else you’d like to know about the classes?

Customer: Oh, that's good to hear. Um, yeah, I was also wondering, are there any weekend sessions? My weekdays are kinda packed.

AI Receptionist: Yes, we do have weekend classes. We try to accommodate different schedules, so you’ll find a few options on both Saturdays and Sundays. Would you like me to help set up an appointment for your first class?

Customer: Yeah, that’d be great. What do you need from me to get that set up?

AI Receptionist: Perfect! I’ll just need your first name, which I have as Michael, your phone number, and your email address.

Customer: Sure thing. My phone number is 555-0123, and my email is michael.chen@gmail.com.

AI Receptionist: Thank you, Michael. Your appointment is booked, and I’ve also messaged and emailed you the details. You’ll get a reminder before your class. Anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that covers it. Thanks, Bella!

AI Receptionist: You're welcome, Michael. Looking forward to seeing you at the club! Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too! Bye!

AI Receptionist: Bye!
