AI Receptionist: Hi, this is Advanced Tattoo and Piercing Shops. I am Elli, Advanced Tattoo and Piercing Shops AI receptionist. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm Daniel Garcia. Uh, I've been thinking about getting my first tattoo and, well, I'm kinda nervous about the whole process. Do you guys offer consultations to talk about design ideas and, uh, maybe show me around before I commit?

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, Daniel! We offer free consultations where you can discuss design ideas with one of our artists, and they'll guide you through the process. It's a great way to get comfortable and make sure everything's just right before you decide to go ahead with it.
