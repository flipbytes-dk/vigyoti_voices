AI Receptionist: Hi, this is Luxe Hair Studio. I am Charlotte, Luxe Hair Studio AI receptionist. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm Robert Johnson. Uh, I'm looking to get a haircut and maybe some highlights. I've never done highlights before, so I'm a bit, you know, curious... um, do you think it would be a good idea for a first-timer like me?

AI Receptionist: Oh, highlights can definitely add some great dimension to your hair, Robert. Our stylists are really experienced with first-timers, and they'll help you choose shades that complement your natural color. It’s a popular choice, and we’ll guide you through it so you feel comfortable and happy with the result.

Customer: That sounds good. Uh, how long does the whole process usually take?

AI Receptionist: Typically, a haircut and highlights can take around two to three hours, depending on your hair length and the look you're going for. We make sure our clients have a relaxing experience while they’re here.

Customer: Alright, that sounds manageable. Can I book an appointment for, like, maybe next week?

AI Receptionist: Absolutely, I can help with that. Could I have your first name, phone number, and email to get started?

Customer: Sure, it's Robert... phone number is 555-0123, and my email is robert.j@email.com.

AI Receptionist: Great, Robert. Thank you for the information. Your appointment is booked, and I have also messaged and emailed you the details. If you have any other questions or want to make changes, feel free to reach out.

Customer: Thanks, Charlotte. I appreciate the help.

AI Receptionist: You're welcome, Robert! We look forward to seeing you at Luxe Hair Studio. Have a great day!

Customer: Thanks, you too!
