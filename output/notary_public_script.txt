AI Receptionist: Hi, this is Total Notary Public Services. I am Dorothy, Total Notary Public Services AI receptionist. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi there, I'm Christopher Lee. Um, I was wondering about getting a couple of documents notarized. It's, uh, for a real estate transaction. Could you tell me if I need to bring anything specific for that?

AI Receptionist: Sure, Christopher! For real estate transactions, you'll usually need to bring a valid photo ID, and, of course, the documents that need to be notarized. We, uh, recommend bringing any additional documents that might be related, just in case.

Customer: Got it, thanks. And, um, do you guys handle this type of thing pretty often?
